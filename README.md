# 🐾 Wildlife Detection AI Project

This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and alert for the presence of wildlife near roadsides, helping to prevent animal-vehicle collisions. The solution is implemented and trained using Google Colab with dataset support from Roboflow.

---

## 📌 Features

- Setup YOLOv8 in Google Colab
- Prepare and download dataset via Roboflow (in YOLOv8 + PyTorch format)
- Train YOLOv8 model on wildlife image dataset
- Generate predictions and alerts
- Playback alert sound on detection

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Wildlife-Detection-AI-Project-.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step YOLOv8 setup, dataset loading, and training
- Roboflow Dataset — Exported in YOLOv8 format
- Custom sounds — Played on wildlife detection

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Open the notebook in Google Colab**
   - Upload or clone this repo into Colab
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   !pip install ultralytics playsound
   ```
3. **Clone your repo or dataset**
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Wildlife-Detection-AI-Project
   ```
4. **Download the dataset from Roboflow**
   - Export in YOLOv8 format and paste the `curl` command into the notebook
5. **Train the model**
   ```python
   model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
   model.train(data="data.yaml", epochs=50)
   ```
6. **Run detection and play sound**
   - Alert sound will play on successful detection using `playsound`
